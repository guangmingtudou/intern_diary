# Internship at Nokia

## Week 1

### 2026/1/28
This is the end of this week, the end of my first week at Nokia. For the first week I tried to initialize my working environment as soon as possible to get into work. I got my laptop for work, installed some softwares that I've used to work with, along with some new ones that I got to kown during the conversations to my supervisor, and started to learn about my work. 

My task is to design and optimize an algorithm for root cause analysis (RCA) in specific networks. After some researches, we propose some solutions: Graph Convolutional Network with explainer and Bayesian Network. GNN is highly recommended in this task, because it aggregates information from neighboring nodes, which leverages the structure of graph of networks, and with multiple layers, it allows information to flow through multiple edges.

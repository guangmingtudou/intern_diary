## Week 2

### 2026/1/22
It has been 4 days, and this week is approaching the end, but it is at this time that I finally have some clear idea of the project. GCN is a great algorithm, but fails when facing data with no label. So these days we're considering detecting relations instead of finding root directly. I'm reading some papers to draw inspiration for improving our algorithm, since it has to run for about 5 hours to get all the rules.
